# Welcome to the Docker wiki!

**Docker** is a lightweight container virtualization software which utilizes **image-based containers** in order to promote reproducibility of software deployment through process isolation. By employing the kernel of a Linux host, Docker is granted access to _Namespaces_, _Control Groups_, and the _SELinux_ protocol which are used to maintain container isolation. These isolated **containers** are constructed using a **layered image model** by which the state of the container is held in a read-only layer of image layers. Docker proceeds to consolidate the image layers, creating a writable container layer to host the image while it is running. Dockerâ€™s containment infrastructure is made available to the user as the **Docker Engine**.
